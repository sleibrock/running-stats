# Running Stats

My personal running log data (recorded and hacked together with Racket)

## About

This is a website generated entirely with Racket. The website is hosted currently on GitLab Pages, and utilizes the GitLab CI to build the webpage and push it to my repo's Pages section. The only thing I have to do to update this page is simply add more records to the Racket code.

Using Racket's `plot` library I generate a graph and embed it into a basic web page which then is hosted on GitLab pages.
